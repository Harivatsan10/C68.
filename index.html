        <p>I was fascinated about video games when i was just four years!But in never liked the games that someone else made.So one day when i got to know about youtube i searched how to make your own game there were thousands of results and i was confused which one to start with. So i just left it.After a year i thought why can't i make my own game?I serched it again and i found loads and loads of softwares i learnt them slowly and i was not understanding how to code!I saw various youtubers but didn't understand. thought why is it so?I just searched how to setup the software and found that i need to do it in a computer or a laptop!I quickly onned my laptop and started downloading and guess what?I learnt coding. Then onwards coding games is my favourite hobby!! </p>
